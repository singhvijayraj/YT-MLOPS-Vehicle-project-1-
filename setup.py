"""
This is a `setup.py` file used for packaging a Python project.

ðŸ“Œ Purpose:
- Makes your project installable via `pip install .`
- Allows you to share/distribute your code as a package.
- Helps tools like `pip`, `build`, and `setuptools` understand your project structure.

ðŸ“Œ Key Points:
- `setuptools` is a Python library that simplifies packaging Python projects.
- `find_packages()` automatically finds all Python packages (folders with `__init__.py` files) in your project.
- The arguments inside `setup()` describe your package metadata.

Once created, you can install your package locally by running:
    pip install -e .

This lets you import your modules anywhere on your system without needing relative paths.
