Here’s a clean, professional, and recruiter-friendly **README.md** that summarizes your project clearly without overloading it with implementation details, but still shows you understand MLOps, data engineering, and deployment workflows. I’ll also highlight the fact you used Render instead of AWS and added a custom model registry.

# Vehicle Price Prediction – End-to-End ML Project (MLOps)

This project demonstrates a **complete Machine Learning workflow**: from dataset ingestion and MongoDB integration to model training, evaluation, and cloud deployment.
It follows a production-grade structure inspired by industry practices — modular code, pipelines, CI/CD, and containerized deployment — and is deployed on **Render** (as an alternative to AWS).

---

## **Key Features**

* **Data Pipeline**

  * Ingest raw data from MongoDB Atlas
  * Perform automated **Data Validation** and **Feature Engineering**
  * Transform data into training-ready format

* **Model Pipeline**

  * Modular **training pipeline** with configuration management
  * Custom **model registry (local filesystem)** instead of AWS S3
  * Automatic **model evaluation** and versioning

* **Deployment**

  * FastAPI backend with REST endpoints
  * Streamlit/HTML interface for demo predictions
  * **Deployed on Render Cloud** with environment variables for secrets (no AWS required)

* **MLOps Practices**

  * CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions
  * Logging & exception handling for traceability
  * Virtual environment reproducibility (`requirements.txt`)

---

## **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Source**: Uploaded raw data to **MongoDB Atlas**
2. **ETL Process**: Built modular ingestion, validation, and transformation steps
3. **Model Training**: Implemented configurable training pipeline
4. **Model Registry**: Stored trained models locally with version tracking
5. **Deployment**:

   * Backend served via **FastAPI**
   * Hosted on **Render Dynamic Web Service**
   * Environment variables configured for MongoDB URL and pipeline secrets

---

## **Tech Stack**

* **Languages**: Python 3.10+
* **Frameworks**: FastAPI, Streamlit (UI demo)
* **Data**: MongoDB Atlas
* **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy
* **MLOps Tools**: GitHub Actions (CI), Render (CD)
* **Other Utilities**: logging, pydantic, custom configuration management

## **How to Run Locally**

```bash
# 1. Clone repo and navigate
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>

# 2. Create and activate virtual environment
conda create -n vehicle python=3.10 -y
conda activate vehicle

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Set environment variable (example for bash)
export MONGODB_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster-url"

# 5. Start FastAPI server
uvicorn app:app --reload
```
